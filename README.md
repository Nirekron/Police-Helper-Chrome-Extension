The extension can be used only on the domain mdt.swrp.cz/search_criminals. If you want to create a fine, the extension will evaluate the fine based 
on your words and complete the other fields for you. It will also alert you to several important things, such as the possible imprisonment of suspects, etc. 
Extensions can be turned off either using the menu at the top right as already mentioned or if the suspect is searched via mdt.swrp.cz/search_criminals/[citizeID]. 
In this case, the extension will not respond to your entered data.
